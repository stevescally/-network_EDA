# NEDA (Network Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Overview

This project analizes publicly available network focused datasets to provide
insight into network activity as well as determine if machine learning concepts
can be implemented to accurately determine a similar conclusion automaticly. It
is expected that additional tooling for performing dataset maintence will also
come about.

## Environment Configuration

* [Install Anaconda on Ubuntu 22](docs/anaconda_ubuntu_22.md)
