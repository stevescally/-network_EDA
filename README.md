# NEDA (Network Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Overview

This project analizes publicly available network focused datasets to provide
insight into network activity as well as determine if machine learning concepts
can be implemented to accurately determine a similar conclusion automaticly. It
is expected that additional tooling for performing dataset maintence will also
come about.

## Environment Configuration

* [Install Anaconda on Ubuntu 22](docs/anaconda_ubuntu_22.md) 

## (Jupyter) Notebook Templates

This directory contains frequently used notebook templates to quickly setup
common formats, layouts, or commands used within the exploratory process.
Different templates are available depending on the expected analysis work.
