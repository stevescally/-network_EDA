# IP Address Data Enrichment

Its possible that this data or process may change however, currently,
it is expected that datasets, notebooks and scripts within this section
perform work related to IP address data.

# Directories

## data_sets/download

This directory contains the soure or original datasets that are being analzed
or used to complement another dataset.

## data_sets/generated

This directory contains datasets generated from notebook analysis and is
typically the aggregation or cleaned version of the final dataset. Some
datasets here may also be supplimental data for other datasets.

## notebooks

This directory contains the jupyter notebook(s) used in analyzing and
aggregating the source data into further usable datasets.

## scripts

This directory contains the scripts used to produce the intermediatary or final
datasets presented in the notebooks. These scripts should be considered
standalone and expect to be provided the source and supplimental datasets while
producing the expected generated output files.
