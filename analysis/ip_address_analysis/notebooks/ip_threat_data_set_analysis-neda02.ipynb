    "IP address threat feeds track numerous registered properties about IP addresses that attempt logins, bruteforce, spam, etc. However the network origination does not appear to have regular correlation to track which Autonmous System Numbers the traffic traverses. Here we will analyze a small subset of lists for their difference, similarities and upstream peers to attempt decerning a pattern of malicious AS number peers keeping in mind the volume or level of service the provider is at. Tier1, Tier2, Tier3..etc.  Further we will attempt to develop an associated ranking of AS numbers taking into account their network size. \n",
