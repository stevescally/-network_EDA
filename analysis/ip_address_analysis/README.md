# IP Address Data Analysis

Its possible that this data or process may change however, currently,
it is expected that data sets, notebooks and scripts within this section
perform work related to IP address data analysis.

# Directories

### data_sets/download

This directory contains the source or original data sets that are being analyzed
or used to complement another data set.

### data_sets/generated

This directory contains data sets generated from notebook analysis and is
typically the aggregation or cleaned version of the final data set. Some
data sets here may also be supplemental data for other data sets.

## [notebooks](notebooks)

This directory contains the Jupyter notebook(s) used in analyzing and
aggregating the source data into further usable data sets.

## scripts

This directory contains the scripts used to produce the intermediary or final
data sets presented in the notebooks. These scripts should be considered
standalone and expect to be provided the source and supplemental data sets while
producing the expected generated output files.
